# Crypto Sniper Bot (Go)

A Go-based crypto trading bot designed to track profitable wallets and execute trades automatically based on their activity. This bot monitors wallet behavior in real-time and places trades as new opportunities are detected.

## Overview

This project is intended for tracking popular and profitable wallets on the blockchain. It listens to wallet activity and replicates their trades to take advantage of early entry opportunities, especially during the initial moments of new token listings.

## Features

- **Wallet Tracking**: Detects and follows transactions from predefined wallet addresses.
- **Real-Time Execution**: Uses WebSockets or RPC polling to react to transactions instantly.
- **Trade Automation**: Automatically places buy/sell orders using customizable logic.
- **Configurable Strategy**: Adjust which wallets to track, slippage, token filters, and more.
- **Containerized Deployment**: Ready-to-run with Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Modular Structure**: Clean, extendable codebase written in Go.
